# Workshop Game Design

The first part of the workshop is a simple interactive game that attendees participate in, allowing everyone to get a visceral understanding of the system before diving into the architectural explanation.

#### Summary
Workshop attendees compete to see who can submit and/or photograph the most-purchased items in the Hello, Retail! Catalog.

#### Instructions to attendees before the workshop
* You will need a personal amazon.com account login registered with your name.
* Bring in 3 real, physical items to feature in the workshop online store.
* Bring a cell phone on which you can send and receive SMS texts and images.

#### Detail
* The room is divided in half - group A and group B.
* First, group A members play the role of merchant and enter their items into the catalog.
* Meanwhile, group B members register their phone numbers as photographers and get photo assignments to take pictures of the objects.
* Photographers seek out and find the merchant and work together to complete a photo shoot of their item.
* Once all of the objects are photographed, attendees switch roles - allowing everyone to be both a photographer and a merchant.
* When the catalog is populated with items, all participants browse the catalog and "purchase" three items.

#### Later on...
* After the workshop winner code is written, the best-selling merchant and best-selling photographer win the prize.
* Best selling merchant is determined by the number of purchase events against the products that merchant entered.
* Best selling photographer is determined by the number of purchase events against the products that photographer photographed.
